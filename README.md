# Random-Data-Projects
A space to showcase data projects I work on for fun, friends, or learning.

1) **Tweets Sentiment Analysis:** To polish my PySpark skills and familiarize with the Databricks environment, I created this notebook. The goal was to:
- perform light Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to gain some interesting insights about the data. For example: Missing data, top hashtags, user mentions, and temporal distribtuion of tweets.
- Fit a VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer model to predict sentiment scores for the tweets.
- Analyze the classification results using actual label and predicted label.
