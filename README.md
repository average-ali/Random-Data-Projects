# Random-Data-Projects
A space to showcase data projects I work on for fun, friends, or learning.

1) **Tweets Sentiment Analysis:** I created this notebook to polish my PySpark skills and familiarize myself with the Databricks environment. The goal was to:
- perform light Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to gain some interesting insights about the dataâ€” for example Missing data, top hashtags, user mentions, and temporal distribution of tweets.
- Fit a VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer model to predict sentiment scores for the tweets.
- Analyze the classification results using actual and predicted labels.
